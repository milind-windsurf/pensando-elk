ELK based analytics for Pensado Systems

This repository is the starting point for building and utlizing the Elasticstack for monitoring and analyzing
data, both about and traversing, the Pensando DSS(es) - DSC(s) coming soon - within your environment.  The purpose is to consolidate the
applications and tools used for said monitoring and analysis and deploy them in an automated fashion.

Instantiation can be done on any system with docker and docker-compose installed.

## Running ELK-Pensando
  #### Documented version
  To get up and running with Pensando's ELK implementation, but need a bit more guidance than a basic readme, [click here](https://pensando.gitlab.io/tbd/elastic/elk-pensando/index.html)

  #### Quick Start
  NOTE: Use this if you are running on a *nix system, don't need docker(-compose) help and understand basic ELK admin
  1. Clone this repository

  2. Change into the directory where it is stored

  3. Create the file '.env' and add the following to it (change 8.0.0 if the version of ELK you want is different):
      ```
      TAG=8.0.0
      ```

  4. Create the following 2 directories and give them full write permissions (777 works)
      ```
      ./data/es_backups
      ./data/pensando_es
      ```

  5. Ensure that you update ```vm.max_map_count``` on your system so that elasticsearch can store it's inidices correctly
      ```
      sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
      sudo echo vm.max_map_count=262144 >> /etc/sysctl.conf
      ```

  6. Run

     If using docker-compose v1 (standalone)

     `docker-compose up`

     Or if using docker-compose v2 (docker plug-in)

     `docker compose up`

  7. Give it about 5 minutes to start up and point your browser to the ip of your ELK cluster, port 5601

  8. In Kibana, import ```./kibana/pensando-dss-elk.ndjson``` into your saved objects

  9. Using PSM, point your DSS firewall syslog (RFC5424) at the IP of your ELK cluster, port 5514
